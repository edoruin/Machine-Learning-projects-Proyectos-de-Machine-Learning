## Salary Prediction

### About the Project

In this project, I created a linear regression model in R Studio to predict the salaries of employees at a fictitious company based on the variables age and experience. I used metrics and graphs to analyze:

- The relationship between the predictor variables and the salary variable.
- The relationship between the predictor variables themselves to assess multicollinearity.
- The model's performance and how the variables affect its performance.

I used metrics such as RMSE and R^2 to evaluate the model's accuracy and understand how the variables explain the variability in salaries.


## Installation

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer.
